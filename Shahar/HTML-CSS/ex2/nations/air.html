        <h1>The Air Nation</h1>
        <p class="my-text">The Air Nomads were the collective of the airbender people.
             Though the people of this nation were nomadic, the Air Nomads raised children and situated their central governments
              in four monastic temples located at various ends of the globe, two for males and two for females.
               The four air temples are located on small archipelagos that were Air Nomad land on the tip of mountains and, in one case, hanging under cliffs.
            The Air Nomads were loosely run by elder councils, one male and one female.
             Each council was run by a head monk or head nun. Their people were extremely spiritual.

            In 0 AG, the Fire Nation executed a mass invasion and genocide of the Air Nomads,
             driving the nation into near extinction save for Avatar Aang, who managed to escape. It is sometimes referred to as the Air Nation in Fire Nation propaganda.
              Upon its reestablishment in 171 AG, the new airbenders are widely known to be part of the Air Nation.</p>
