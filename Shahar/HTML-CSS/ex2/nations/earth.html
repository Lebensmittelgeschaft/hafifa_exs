        <h1>The Earth Nation</h1>
        <p class="my-text">The Earth Kingdom is the largest and most diverse of the four nations, comprised of a massive continent in the eastern hemisphere and several islands.
             The nation's people are strong and proud, with some of them being earthbenders. The Earth Kingdom is extremely diverse,
              having mountainous, forested, grassland, desert, and man-conquered areas, including the vast megacity of Ba Sing Se.[5] Due to its peoples'
             bending ability, the people of the Earth Kingdom have created magnificent structures out of stone, such as the city Omashu.
The Earth Kingdom was originally run overall as a monarchy, the capital being Ba Sing Se, though some smaller regions and cities have their own rule,
 such as Omashu, which had its own king. From 171 to 174 AG, the kingdom went without a monarch following the anarchy in the Earth Kingdom,
  though the Hou-Ting Dynasty was restored after Kuvira's failed invasion of the United Republic of Nations with the crowning of Wu as king.
   However, the new king intended to abolish the monarchy in favor of independent states with democratically elected governments,
    reminiscent of the United Republic of Nations.</p>
