        <h1>The Fire Nation</h1>
        <p class="my-text">The Fire Nation is the second largest nation and home to both firebenders and nonbenders alike,
             though firebenders were sometimes held in higher respect than nonbenders.
              It is located on an archipelago of islands located in the western hemisphere of the planet and is the most advanced of the four nations,
               with steam and gas power.[5] It started out with a huge fleet of industrial war ships,[6] and later on adopted the use of airships[7] into its military.
The Fire Nation is also diverse in landscape, featuring many volcanic islands in its archipelago and on the mainland,
 as well as a tropical climate. It also has the world's most popular vacation spot, Ember Island.[5]

The country is an absolute monarchy and could even be called a dictatorship. In 0 AG, the Hundred Year War was started by Fire Lord Sozin,
 using his country's advanced technologies.[8] During the Hundred Year War, its people were oppressed and fed propaganda by rulers Sozin,
  Azulon, and Ozai. However, in 100 AG, the Fire Nation's conquest was ended and a new era of peace began, with Zuko as the new leader.</p>
