            <h1>The Water Nation</h1>
            <p class="my-text"> The Water Tribe is a sovereignty of waterbenders and nonbenders.
                There are three tribes: the Northern Water Tribe, centered in the North Pole;
                the Southern Water Tribe, centered in the South Pole; and the Foggy Swamp Tribe, located in the Earth Kingdom's Foggy Swamp.
                Both the Northern and Southern Water Tribes are chiefdoms led by a tribal chief.
                Though the Northern chief was technically the ruler of both tribes, the South maintained control of its own internal affairs
                before ultimately gaining formal independence in 171 AG. On the other hand, the Foggy Swamp Tribe seemingly lacks formal political structure,                    with members in several small settlements functioning without a formal chief.
                Historically, the Northern Water Tribe has maintained a stronger position than its Southern counterpart,
                in part due to its large bending population, which largely remained unscathed during the Hundred Year War.
                In comparison, the Southern Water Tribe was devastated by numerous raids which nearly eliminated the tribe's entire bending population and destroyed its infrastructure.
                A relief effort led by Master Pakku in 100 AG helped restore the Southern Water Tribe to its former glory,
                and the settlement has since expanded to encompass a larger portion of the South Pole.

                All divisions are occasionally referred to collectively as the Water Tribes. Although the Water Tribes adopted a largely isolationist policy during wartime, it welcomed outsiders following the end of the Hundred Year War. The Water Tribes also became more involved in global affairs, with each of the polar divisions having a representative on the United Republic Council prior to its dissolution.</p>
